# Organizational and Educational Resources

This is a public repository for the Flint Hills Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. It contains educational resources to help the public and members to learn more about the Flint Hills Chapter of DSA, the National Democratic Socialists of America organization, and resources to learn about democratic socialism. 

If you have resources you would like to suggest we add to our repo, you can do so [here](https://github.com/flinthillsdsa/resources/issues/) page.
