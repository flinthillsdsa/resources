# What is Socialism?

Socialism is when the working class collectively owns, and democratically operates, the Means of Production (stores, factories, etc.) in order to fulfill the needs of the community.

This is opposed to **Capitalism**, where the Means of Production are privately owned, in order to make profit.

It is also different from **State Capitalism**, where the government controls the Means of Production. A lot of self-proclaimed Socialist/Communist states implemented State Capitalism in order to industrialize, but state ownership alone is not Socialism.

## Major Branches of Socialism

Socialism has two major branches:

### Marxism
Based largely in an analysis of Capitalism formulated by Karl Marx, and proposes that the working class should make use of the state, as a tool in waging revolution. It has many types, including:
- Leninism
- Maoism
- Trotskyism
- Libertarian Marxism

### Anarchism
Based largely in an analysis of hierarchy, and aims to dismantle all hierarchies that can't justify themselves. Many anarchists make use of a Marxist analysis of Capitalism, but want to skip seizing the state all together, and want to build socialism through different means. Some kinds of Anarchism include:
- Anarcho-Communism
- Anarcho-Feminism
- Queer Anarchism

## Related Political Systems

### Social Democracy
A kind of Capitalism that promotes a strong welfare state.

### Democratic Socialism
Different from Social Democracy, in that it is actually Socialist. It opposes Capitalism, and emphasizes democratic political systems, alongside democratic control over the Means of Production. Sometimes it's more reformist, and other times it's more revolutionary. It's more of an umbrella term than a specific leftist tendency. Democratic Socialists of America, for example, have caucuses for various tendencies (Marxism, Anarchism, etc.), and George Orwell was a Democratic Socialist who fought in a Trotskyist group during the Spanish Civil War.

## The Ultimate Goal: Communism

All kinds of Socialism have the long term goal of **Communism**, which is a classless, stateless, moneyless society, based on the principle of:

> "From each according to their ability. To each according to their need."
