# Educational Resources

This directory is a living library of primers, reading lists, study guides, zines, videos, and workshop materials that introduce—and critically engage with—socialism, democratic socialism, Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, and other traditions of revolutionary and anti-imperialist thought. Whether you’re taking your first steps toward unlearning capitalism and colonialism or looking to deepen your understanding of class struggle, liberation movements, and transformative praxis, you’ll find accessible entry points alongside more advanced texts here. Everything is organized for self-guided study or group discussion, with an emphasis on intersectional analysis, historical context, and practical organizing skills. Dive in, explore, and feel free to [suggest additions](https://github.com/orgs/flinthillsdsa/discussions/1) so the collection keeps growing with the movement.

## How this page is organized
We group items by **learning stage** first, then by the **tradition or focus** of the text.  
*(Think of it as a two-layer shelf: Level → Lens.)*

| Stage | What you’ll find | Typical length |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **Start Here** | Extremely accessible primers, FAQs, explainers. | 1–20 pp or ≤ 30 min |
| **Digging Deeper** | Foundational works that build conceptual muscle. | 20–200 pp or ≤ 2 hr |
| **Theory & Praxis** | Advanced analysis, historical documents, case studies. | 200 pp+ or ≥ 2 hr |

Within each stage, resources are separated into five lenses:

1. **Marx & Engels** – the originals and close commentaries  
2. **Lenin & Early 20th C.** – Lenin, Luxemburg, Gramsci, Trotsky, etc.  
3. **Anti-Colonial & Maoist Currents** – Mao, Fanon, Cabral, Ho Chi Minh…  
4. **Contemporary & Intersectional** – ecosocialism, feminist/queer, abolition, decolonial, etc.  
5. **Organizing Handbooks** – strike guides, tenant manuals, security culture, digital tools
