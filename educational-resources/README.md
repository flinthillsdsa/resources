# Educational Resources

This directory is a living library of primers, reading lists, study guides, zines, videos, and workshop materials that introduce—and critically engage with—socialism, democratic socialism, Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, and other traditions of revolutionary and anti-imperialist thought. Whether you’re taking your first steps toward unlearning capitalism and colonialism or looking to deepen your understanding of class struggle, liberation movements, and transformative praxis, you’ll find accessible entry points alongside more advanced texts here. Everything is organized for self-guided study or group discussion, with an emphasis on intersectional analysis, historical context, and practical organizing skills. Dive in, explore, and feel free to [suggest additions](https://github.com/orgs/flinthillsdsa/discussions/1) so the collection keeps growing with the movement.
